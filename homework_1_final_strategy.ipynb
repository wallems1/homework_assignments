    "## Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy relies on a few different things, primairily on the amount of each  move taken by our opponent.\n",
    "Essentially, counters are initialized to keep track of each rock, paper and scissors move taken and are kept track of\n",
    "when partner history is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where one move is found to be done less than the others, we select the move to play against the opponent that would beat them (ie. if rock is being played the least, we play the move that would defeat it (paper). In the cases where two move type amounts are equal and less than the 3rd option, we select the move that would defeat that 3rd option. In the final edge case where all move counts are equal, we choose randomly a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our model considers what happens when fitness is poor. If our fitness is under some threshold (after some amount of moves) we throw a random move to reset our trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was written and tested by all group members (Sarah Kleppe, Emily Wall, Danielle Ziaja, William Zygmunt). We all contributed other ideas that didn't make it into the final version of the code and contributed ideas."
