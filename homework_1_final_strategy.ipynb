    "## Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Our 1st strategy bases its move selection on randomly generating a first move and then successively picking the next move based on that. Essentially, it starts a sequence of moves (ie. R-P-S-R-P-S-...) and keeps that sequence of moves throughout play time. This strategy is simple and not very dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Our 2nd strategy relies on a few different things, primairily on the amount of each moves taken by our opponent.\n",
    "Essentially, counters are initialized to keep track of each rock, paper and scissors move taken and are kept track of\n",
    "when partner history is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where one move is found to be played less than the others, we select the move to play against the opponent that would beat them (ie. if rock is being played the least, we play the move that would defeat it (paper)). In the cases where two move type amounts are equal and less than the 3rd option, we select the move that would defeat that 3rd option. In the final edge case where all move counts are equal, we choose randomly a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our model considers what happens when fitness is poor. If our fitness is under some threshold (after some amount of moves) we throw a random move to reset our trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "I contributed code for the first strategy on my own, but the 2nd strategy was a group effort. I contributed code and did bug fixes along with other group members based on the base strategy (Sarah Kleppe) and the idea of looking at fitness as a threshold (Emily Wall, Danielle Ziaja) and then all group members contributed to testing of solution parameters."
